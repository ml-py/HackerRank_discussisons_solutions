## HackerRank 11 TriangleQuest2 123454321 ⠀ also called ⠀ 'Demlo numbers'.
Python files contains solutions from discusion for the specific contest.<br>  Often the solution is broken appart for small pieces ⠀so we get break points ⠀in need to give the idea of steps taken by code in order to achieve the final solution.<br> Solutions are mostly grouped by their ideas. <br> Solutions are grouped by ideas they represent. <br>  Files are written in a Jupyter notebook manner:
``` python
''' Author of the solution ''',  ''' maybe some comment '''
python_code doing sth:
    pass
''' output of the code '''
```


It can be usefull to uncomment parts of prints ⠀and ⠀than the arrow ⠀ ` print("\n==========>\n") ` ⠀ pointing to the particular output.
