## HackerRank 11 TriangleQuest2 123454321 ⠀also called ⠀'Demlo numbers'.

### This repo contains analysis of solutions from discussions on HackerRank.com for a specific contest. <br> Scroll down for contest topic.



Often the solution is broken into small pieces ⠀so we get break points ⠀in need to give the idea of steps taken by code in order to achieve the final solution.<br> Solutions are grouped by ideas they represent. <br>  Files are written in a Jupyter notebook manner:
``` python
''' Author of the solution ''',  ''' maybe some comment '''
python_code doing sth:
    pass
''' output of the code '''
```




It can be useful to uncomment parts of prints ⠀and ⠀then the arrow ⠀ **` print("\n==========>\n") `** ⠀ pointing to the particular output.

In case of contest **` HackerRank 11 TriangleQuest2 123454321 `**  it contains all solutions from the beginning up to the date of scraping,  which was 2020-01-30.
