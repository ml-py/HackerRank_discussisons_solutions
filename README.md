### This repo contains analysis of solutions from discussions on HackerRank.com for the specific contest.



Often the solution is broken appart for small pieces ⠀so we get break points ⠀in need to give the idea of steps taken by code in order to achieve the final solution.<br> Solutions are mostly grouped by their ideas. <br> Solutions are grouped by ideas they represent. <br>  Files are written in a Jupyter notebook manner:
``` python
''' Author of the solution ''',  ''' maybe some comment '''
python_code doing sth:
    pass
''' output of the code '''
```




It can be usefull to uncomment parts of prints ⠀and ⠀than the arrow ⠀ **` print("\n==========>\n") `** ⠀ pointing to the particular output.
